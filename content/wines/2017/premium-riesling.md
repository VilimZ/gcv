overview1 = 'This premium riesling is nothing short of world class. Unmistakable citrus, salinity and even a slight chalkiness characterise the palate. The acidity is great, but supremely well balanced.'

tastingnotes = 'Pale green in appearance with typical Clare Valley Riesling characters of lemon, lime and grapefruit plus some subtle bath powder notes on display as well. The palate is fresh, crisp and dry with a touch of talc; the concentrated flavours and balanced acidity in harmony with the long, textural finish. Try with Greek style chargrilled octopus.'

growingseason = 'The 2017 vintage was shaped by a cool, wet winter and spring with above average rainfall. Budburst was later than the “recent normal” due to the cooler conditions in September and as a result harvest was also a little late – we commenced vintage on March 3rd. Leading up to harvest January and February were both quite mild with no extended periods of heat and little rain. The 20mm we did receive on 20th January finished the vineyards off nicely. The 2017 vintage will be remembered as one of the top Riesling vintages since the turn of the century along with 2002, 2005, 2009 & 2012.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were both hand & machine harvested, transported to the winery, de stemmed, pressed and the juice chilled prior to the being partially clarified by cold settling – some solids were retained for texture and added complexity. It was then inoculated with a pure yeast culture, with fermentation carried out in stainless steel temperature controlled tanks for 25-30 days. After fermentation the wine was fined, stabilised and then filtered prior to bottling.'

reviews = "Don't just take our word for it. See what customers and critics are saying about the GCV Celtic Farm Riesling."

testemonials = '4 trophies, 3 in riesling categories, and Best Wine of Show at the Clare Valley Wine Show ’15. This starts where its gold medal-winning sibling finishes; it is awesome in the way it exerts its power, taking hold of the palate without any fuss, then tightening and lengthening its grip each time it is retasted. The rainbow of citrus fruits pays scant attention to the slatey acidity that is the bedrock of its long-term development. Screwcap. 12.5% alc. 97/100 points.'
