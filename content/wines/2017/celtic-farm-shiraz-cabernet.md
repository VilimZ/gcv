testemonialonyears = 'Deep red in colour, the wine displays ripe satsuma plum and blackcurrant, a little chocolate and a hint of cedary French oak. The palate is quite rich but retains a degree of elegance with its balanced acidity. It also has a good depth of juicy, fleshy dark berry fruit. A really attractive Clare red blend which will repay medium term cellaring – say 3-6 years.'

tastingnotes = 'Bright red with perfumed aromatics of fresh plums, red fruits with hints of bayleaf and thyme. A long and seductive palate showing why these two varieties marry so well. The Shiraz provides the sweetness and red berry fruits with a plush and velvety mid palate. The Cabernet adding the granular tannin structure and long savoury finish of green olive and bayleaf. Oak plays a supporting role adding texture and spice.'

growingseason = 'The 2017 vintage was shaped by a cool, wet winter and spring with above average rainfall. Budburst was later than the “recent normal” due to the cooler conditions in September and as a result harvest was also a little late – we commenced vintage on March 3rd. Leading up to harvest January and February were both quite mild with no extended periods of heat and little rain. The 20mm we did receive on 20th January finished the vineyards off nicely. The 2017 vintage will be remembered as one of the top Riesling vintages since the turn of the century along with 2002, 2005, 2009 & 2012.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were machine harvested in the cool, early hours of the morning, transported to the winery to be crushed, chilled and pressed as soon as possible prior to the juice being clarified by cold settling. It was then inoculated with a pure yeast culture, with fermentation carried out in stainless steel temperature controlled tanks for on average 25-30 days. The wine was fined, stabilised then filtered prior to bottling.'

reviews = "Don't just take our word for it. See what customers and critics are saying about the GCV Celtic Farm Shiraz Cabernet."

testemonials = 'Deep crimson-purple: combinations of some or all of these varieties have always prospered in the Clare Valley, Wendouree and Leasingham Bin 56 being examples. This ticks the boxes set by those great wines. Deep crimson-purple, red and black berry fruits hold hands, encouraged by ripe tannins. 93/100 points.'
