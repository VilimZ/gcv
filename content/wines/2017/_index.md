vintagenotes = 'The 2017 vintage was shaped by a cool, wet winter and spring with above average rainfall. Budburst was later than the “recent normal” due to the cooler conditions in September and as a result harvest was also a little late – we commenced vintage on March 3rd. Leading up to harvest January and February were both quite mild with no extended periods of heat and little rain. The 20mm we did receive on 20th January finished the vineyards off nicely. The 2017 vintage will be remembered as one of the top Riesling vintages since the turn of the century along with 2002, 2005, 2009 & 2012.'
