overview1 = 'This premium riesling is nothing short of world class. Unmistakable citrus, salinity and even a slight chalkiness characterise the palate. The acidity is great, but supremely well balanced.'

tastingnotes = 'Pale green in appearance with typical Clare Valley Riesling characters of lemon, lime and apple with some floral honeysuckle aspects on display along with a little mineral flintiness. The palate is fresh, crisp and dry ; the concentrated flavours and balanced acidity ensuring a long, textural finish. Try with Gruyere cheese.'

growingseason = 'The 2013 vintage commenced quite early for most winemakers in the Clare Valley – it was the 8th February for us. A cool winter with average rainfall was followed by a warm, dry spring and dry summer that delivered sound fruit to the winery for vinification. The resultant wines are really very good – possibly better than anticipated given the warm growing season. Lower alcohols, pure concentrated citrus flavours and balanced acidity are the hallmarks of this vintage.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were both hand & machine harvested, transported to the winery, de stemmed, pressed and the juice chilled prior to the being partially clarified by cold settling – some solids were retained for texture and added complexity. It was then inoculated with a pure yeast culture, with fermentation carried out in stainless steel temperature controlled tanks for 25-30 days. After fermentation the wine was fined, stabilised and then filtered prior to bottling.'

reviews = "Don't just take our word for it. See what customers and critics are saying about the GCV Celtic Farm Riesling."

testemonials = '4 trophies, 3 in riesling categories, and Best Wine of Show at the Clare Valley Wine Show ’15. This starts where its gold medal-winning sibling finishes; it is awesome in the way it exerts its power, taking hold of the palate without any fuss, then tightening and lengthening its grip each time it is retasted. The rainbow of citrus fruits pays scant attention to the slatey acidity that is the bedrock of its long-term development. Screwcap. 12.5% alc. 97/100 points.'
