vintagenotes = 'The 2013 vintage was one of the earliest on record for the Clare Valley beginning in early February. While most of South Eastern Australia was affected by the continuance of a severe drought, rainfall in the Clare Valley was almost average. An early budburst followed by a warm spring and summer hastened the ripening of all varieties which meant timing of harvest was critical. The resultant wines have excellent up front flavour concentration and balanced acidity.'
