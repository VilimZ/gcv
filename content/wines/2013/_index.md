vintagenotes = 'The 2013 vintage commenced quite early for most winemakers in the Clare Valley – it was the 8th February for us. A cool winter with average rainfall was followed by a warm, dry spring and dry summer that delivered sound fruit to the winery for vinification. The resultant wines are really very good – possibly better than anticipated given the warm growing season. Lower alcohols, pure concentrated citrus flavours and balanced acidity are the hallmarks of this vintage.'
