overview1 = 'The "entry level" Riesling but one that seriously over-delivers. Purity and flavor are abundant and it makes for sensational value.'

tastingnotes = 'Pale green in appearance with typical Clare Valley Riesling citrus characters of lemon and lime on full display along with some attractive floral notes. The palate is crisp, dry and fresh; the balanced acidity ensuring a bright, clean finish. Great with any seafood – but the match with freshly shucked oysters is hard to go past.'

growingseason = 'The 2013 vintage commenced quite early for most winemakers in the Clare Valley – it was the 8th February for us. A cool winter with average rainfall was followed by a warm, dry spring and dry summer that delivered sound fruit to the winery for vinification. The resultant wines are really very good – possibly better than anticipated given the warm growing season. Lower alcohols, pure concentrated citrus flavours and balanced acidity are the hallmarks of this vintage'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were machine harvested in the cool, early hours of the morning, transported to the winery to be crushed, chilled and pressed as soon as possible prior to the juice being clarified by cold settling. It was then inoculated with a pure yeast culture, with fermentation carried out in stainless steel temperature controlled tanks for on average 25-30 days. The wine was fined, stabilised then filtered prior to bottling.'

reviews = "Don't just take our word for it. See what customers and critics are saying about the GCV Celtic Farm Riesling."

testemonials = 'The less expensive, more ready to rumble little brother of the Gaelic Cemetery Riesling. More weight and less purity than its big brother, but more open and affable as a youngster. There’s a slight chalkiness to the texture and a twist of lime rind bitterness on the finish along with lime, lemon, apple and bathroom florals. Clean acidity and juicy sweetness makes this a very good drink. 94/100 points'
