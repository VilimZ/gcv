tastingnotes = 'Deep red/black colour typical of the red wines from the low yielding Gaelic Cemetery Vineyard. This wine displays concentrated dark cherry and ripe plum fruit aromas with flecks of chocolate and mocha. It also shows a little of the typical ironstone/ferrous elements we associate with this site. The full-bodied palate is all dark berries and ripe plums, finishing with a swirl of sweet fruit and a lick of the Gaelic Cemetery signature tannins. It will take decade or more to unwind and show its true colours. Great with something retro like medium rare beef wellington.'

growingseason = 'The 2013 vintage commenced quite early for most winemakers in the Clare Valley – it was the 8th February for us. A cool winter with average rainfall was followed by a warm, dry spring and dry summer that delivered sound fruit to the winery for vinification. The resultant wines are really very good – possibly better than anticipated given the warm growing season. Lower alcohols, pure concentrated flavours and balanced acidity are the hallmarks of this vintage'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were both machine and hand harvested, transported to the winery, crushed into 4t open fermenters, chilled and cold soaked for approx 4-5 days prior to the natural yeasts kicking in and beginning the ferment. Fermentation was completed within 12 days prior to the wine being pressed and run into new French 228L barrels for just on 18months.'

reviews = "Don't just take our word for it. See what customers and critics are saying about the GCV Premium Shiraz."

testemonials = 'Deep purple-crimson; a very concentrated and powerful full-bodied shiraz with blackberry, dark chocolate, licorice and mocha flavours, the tannins ripe; carries its alcohol: 280 cases made. High quality Cork. 15% alc. 94/100 points.'

testemonialonyears = 'The fruit for this comes from the two oldest blocks of Shiraz on the vineyard. Incredibly deep red, almost black in colour, this wine shows all the usual blackberry, star anise and ferrous characters that we have come to expect from this site.'
