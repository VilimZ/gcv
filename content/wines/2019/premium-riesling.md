overview1 = 'This premium riesling is nothing short of world class. Unmistakable citrus, salinity and even a slight chalkiness characterise the palate. The acidity is great, but supremely well balanced.'

tastingnotes = 'Pale green in appearance with typical Clare Valley Riesling characters of kaffir lime, lemon and bath powder-like florals . The palate is fresh, crisp and quite steely: the concentrated citrus flavours and bright acidity married well with the long, textural talc-like finish. Try with smoked chicken and avocado fettucine. Also good for long term aging – this wine will run for 10+ years without doubt.'

growingseason = 'The vintage was shaped by a typically cool winter, but with below average rainfall. Spring rains were also down. Budburst and flowering were normal and harvest commenced in late February for us. While we experienced above average temperatures during January and much of February, conditions were quite mild once vintage began in earnest. The 2019 vintage will be remembered as another high-quality Clare Riesling vintage with lower alcohols and bright acids a feature of our wines.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were both hand & machine harvested, transported to the winery, de-stemmed, pressed and the juice chilled prior to the being partially clarified by cold settling – some solids were retained for texture and added complexity. It was then inoculated with a pure yeast culture, with fermentation carried out in stainless steel temperature-controlled tanks for 25-30 days. After fermentation the wine was stabilised and then filtered prior to bottling.'

reviews = "Don't just take our word for it. See what customers and critics are saying about the GCV Celtic Farm Riesling."

testemonials = '4 trophies, 3 in riesling categories, and Best Wine of Show at the Clare Valley Wine Show ’15. This starts where its gold medal-winning sibling finishes; it is awesome in the way it exerts its power, taking hold of the palate without any fuss, then tightening and lengthening its grip each time it is retasted. The rainbow of citrus fruits pays scant attention to the slatey acidity that is the bedrock of its long-term development. Screwcap. 12.5% alc. 97/100 points.'
