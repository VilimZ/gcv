overview1 = 'The "entry level" Riesling but one that seriously over-delivers. Purity and flavor are abundant and it makes for sensational value.'

tastingnotes = 'Pale green in appearance with typical Celtic Farm characters of lemon/lime, fresh cut apple and peach along with some attractive floral notes. The palate is crisp, dry and soft - the acidity working well with the tiny amount of residual sweetness on the finish. Great with any seafood really – try it with salt & pepper barramundi – wild catch of course. Worth a few years in the cellar too – say 5-7 years.'

growingseason = 'The vintage was shaped by a typically cool winter, but with below average rainfall. Spring rains were also down. Budburst and flowering were normal and harvest commenced in late February for us. While we experienced above average temperatures during January and much of February, conditions were quite mild once vintage began in earnest. The 2019 vintage will be remembered as another high-quality Clare Riesling vintage with lower alcohols and bright acids a feature of our wines.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were machine harvested in the cool, early hours of the morning, transported to the winery to be crushed, chilled and pressed as soon as possible prior to the juice being clarified by cold settling. It was then inoculated with a pure yeast culture, with fermentation carried out in stainless steel temperature controlled tanks for on average 25-30 days. The wine was fined, stabilised then filtered prior to bottling.'

reviews = "Don't just take our word for it. See what customers and critics are saying about the GCV Celtic Farm Riesling."

testemonials = 'The less expensive, more ready to rumble little brother of the Gaelic Cemetery Riesling. More weight and less purity than its big brother, but more open and affable as a youngster. There’s a slight chalkiness to the texture and a twist of lime rind bitterness on the finish along with lime, lemon, apple and bathroom florals. Clean acidity and juicy sweetness makes this a very good drink. 94/100 points'
