overview1 = 'This premium riesling is nothing short of world class. Unmistakable citrus, salinity and even a slight chalkiness characterise the palate. The acidity is great, but supremely well balanced.'

tastingnotes = 'Pale green appearance with typical Clare Valley Riesling characters on full display, including lemon, lime & citrus blossom - along with a little mineral as well. The palate is crisp, fresh and flavoursome: the balanced acidity ensuring a long, clean finish. The perfect partner with most seafood really – but the match with freshly shucked oysters is wonderful.'

growingseason = 'The 2012 vintage was ideal in every respect for the Clare Valley. A cool, wet winter was followed by a mild spring and summer delivering very sound fruit to the winery for vinification. The resultant wines are quite delicious. Pure, concentrated citrus flavours and bright acidity are the features of this vintage.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were hand harvested and then transported to the winery before being whole bunch pressed and the juice separated from the skins as soon as possible prior to the juice being slightly clarified by cold settling. It was then inoculated with a pure yeast culture, with fermentation carried out in stainless steel temperature controlled tanks for on average 25-30 days. The wine was stabilized and then filtered prior to bottling.'

reviews = "Don't just take our word for it. See what customers and critics are saying about the GCV Celtic Farm Riesling."

testemonials = '"4 trophies, 3 in riesling categories, and Best Wine of Show at the Clare Valley Wine Show ’15. This starts where its gold medal-winning sibling finishes; it is awesome in the way it exerts its power, taking hold of the palate without any fuss, then tightening and lengthening its grip each time it is retasted. The rainbow of citrus fruits pays scant attention to the slatey acidity that is the bedrock of its long-term development. Screwcap. 12.5% alc. 97/100 points.'
