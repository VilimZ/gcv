tastingnotes = 'Pale green appearance with typical Clare Valley Riesling characters on full display, including lemon, lime & grapefruit - along a little mineral.

growingseason = 'The 2012 vintage was ideal in every respect for the Clare Valley. A cool, wet winter was followed by a mild spring and summer delivering very sound fruit to the winery for vinification. The resultant wines are quite delicious. Pure, concentrated citrus flavours and bright acidity are the features of this vintage.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were both machine and hand harvested, transported to the winery, crushed, chilled and pressed as soon as possible prior to the juice being clarified by cold settling. It was then inoculated with a pure yeast culture, with fermentation carried out in stainless steel temperature controlled tanks for on average 25-30 days. The wine was stabilised, blended and then filtered prior to bottling.'

reviews = "Don't just take our word for it. See what customers and critics are saying about the GCV Celtic Farm Riesling."

testemonials = 'The less expensive, more ready to rumble little brother of the Gaelic Cemetery Riesling. More weight and less purity than its big brother, but more open and affable as a youngster. There’s a slight chalkiness to the texture and a twist of lime rind bitterness on the finish along with lime, lemon, apple and bathroom florals. Clean acidity and juicy sweetness makes this a very good drink. 94/100 points'
