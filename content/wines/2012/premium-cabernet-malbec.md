tastingnotes = 'Incredibly deep red, almost black in colour absolutely typical of the Gaelic Cemetery Vineyard. This wine exudes “super ripe” satsuma plum, blackberry, mocha and ironstone. Rich and full on the palate this is a wine of great texture and length. It will take at least a decade, perhaps two, to unwind all the inner nuances that the wine undoubtedly has.'

growingseason = 'The 2007 vintage was on the back of unusual seasonal conditions for the Clare Valley. Most of South Eastern Australia was affected by a severe drought with crop levels being reduced significantly in most regions. A warm, dry growing season meant the grapes accumulated sugar quite rapidly after verasion, so timing of harvest was crucial to making good wines. Those who got it right managed to make high quality wines of great colour and backbone that retained good levels of natural acidity as well as plenty of mid palate flavor.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were both machine and hand harvested, transported to the winery, crushed into 4t open fermenters, chilled and cold soaked for approx 4-5 days prior to the natural yeasts kicking in and beginning the ferment. Fermentation was completed within 12 days prior to the wine being pressed and run into new French 228L barrels for just on 18months.'

reviews = "Don't just take our word for it. See what customers and critics are saying about the GCV Premium Shiraz."

testemonials = 'Deep purple-crimson; a very concentrated and powerful full-bodied shiraz with blackberry, dark chocolate, licorice and mocha flavours, the tannins ripe; carries its alcohol: 280 cases made. High quality Cork. 15% alc. 94/100 points.'

testemonialsauthor = 'James Halliday | The Wine Companion'

testemonialonyears = 'This wine displays intense blackcurrant / mulberry fruit aromas along with some mocha and chocolate notes. Quite concentrated on the palate, but manages to retain a degree of elegance that we expect to see in Cabernet based wines.'
