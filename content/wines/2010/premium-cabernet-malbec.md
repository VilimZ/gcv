growingseason = 'The 2010 vintage was one of the earliest on record for the Clare Valley beginning in early February. While most of South Eastern Australia was affected by the continuance of a severe drought, rainfall in the Clare Valley was almost average. An early budburst followed by a warm spring and summer hastened the ripening of all varieties which meant timing of harvest was critical. The resultant wines have excellent up front flavour concentration and balanced acidity.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were both machine and hand harvested, transported to the winery, crushed into 4t open fermenters, chilled and cold soaked for approx 4-5 days prior to the natural yeasts kicking in and beginning the ferment. Fermentation was completed within 12 days prior to the wine being pressed and run into new and used French 228L barrels for just on 18 months.'
