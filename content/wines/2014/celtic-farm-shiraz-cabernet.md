tastingnotes = 'Deep red in colour, the wine displays ripe satsuma plum and blackcurrant, a little chocolate and a hint of cedary French oak. The palate is quite rich but retains a degree of elegance with its balanced acidity. It also has a good depth of juicy, fleshy dark berry fruit held in check by some fine grained tannins. A really attractive Clare red blend which will repay medium term cellaring – say 3-6 years.'

growingseason = 'The 2014 vintage was shaped by a cool winter with average rainfall followed by a dry and quite warm spring. Budburst was a touch earlier than normal due to the warmer conditions – maybe a week earlier than what is considered average. Summer was very warm to very hot. January was particularly hot at times - only broken up by a week of cooler weather in the third week. Thankfully the heat dissipated mid February and much of the fruit was able to ripen in the cooler months of March & April.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were both machine and hand harvested, transported to the winery, crushed into 4t open fermenters, chilled and cold soaked for approx 4-5 days prior to the natural yeasts kicking in and beginning the ferment. Fermentation was completed within 12 days prior to the wine being pressed and run into new French 228L barrels for just on 18months.'

reviews = "Don't just take our word for it. See what customers and critics are saying about the GCV Celtic Farm Shiraz Cabernet."

testemonials = 'Deep crimson-purple: combinations of some or all of these varieties have always prospered in the Clare Valley, Wendouree and Leasingham Bin 56 being examples. This ticks the boxes set by those great wines. Deep crimson-purple, red and black berry fruits hold hands, encouraged by ripe tannins. 93/100 points.' 

testemonialsauthor = 'James Halliday | The Wine Companion'

testemonialonyears = 'The fruit for this comes from the two oldest blocks of Shiraz on the vineyard. Varying percentages of both blocks make up the Premium depending on the year. Incredibly deep red, almost black in colour, this wine shows all the usual blackberry, star anise and ferrous characters that we have come to expect.'
