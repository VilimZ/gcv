Quite concentrated on the palate, but manages to retain some of the elegance that we expect to see in Cabernet based wines from Clare. It will take several years in the cellar to reveal its undoubted potential. Excellent cellaring proposition. Try with chargrilled scotch fillet.'

growingseason = 'The 2014 vintage was shaped by a cool winter with average rainfall followed by a dry and quite warm spring. Budburst was a touch earlier than normal due to the warmer conditions â€“ maybe a week earlier than what is considered average. Summer was very warm to very hot. January was particularly hot at times - only broken up by a week of cooler weather in the third week. Thankfully the heat dissipated mid February and much of the fruit was able to ripen in the cooler months of March & April.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were both machine and hand harvested, transported to the winery, crushed into 2 tonne open fermenters, chilled and cold soaked for approx 4-5 days prior to the natural yeasts kicking in and beginning the ferment. Fermentation was completed within 12 days prior to the wine being pressed and run into new and used French 225L barrels for just on 18 months.'

reviews = "Don't just take our word for it. See what customers and critics are saying about the GCV Premium Cabernet Malbec."

testemonials = 'Bold and ripe but firm. It establishes authority and exercises it responsibly. Mint, coffee-cream, dark cakey blackberry and spicy/smoky oak. Both powerful and precise. Cork. 14.5% alc. 95/100 points.'
