vintagenotes = 'The 2014 vintage was shaped by a cool winter with average rainfall followed by a dry and quite warm spring. Budburst was a touch earlier than normal due to the warmer conditions â€“ maybe a week earlier than what is considered average. Summer was very warm to very hot. January was particularly hot at times - only broken up by a week of cooler weather in the third week. Thankfully the heat dissipated mid February and much of the fruit was able to ripen in the cooler months of March & April.'
