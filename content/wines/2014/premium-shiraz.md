tastingnotes = 'Deep red/black colour typical of the red wines from the low yielding Gaelic Cemetery Vineyard. This wine displays ripe dark cherry and plum fruit aromas with a little mocha and also some meat/gamey notes somewhere in the mix. The full-bodied palate is rich & ripe, finishing with a lick of the firm GCV signature tannins. It will quite possibly take decade or more to unwind and show its true colours. Great with something retro like beef and Guinness pie.'

growingseason = 'The 2014 vintage was shaped by a cool winter with average rainfall followed by a dry and quite warm spring. Budburst was a touch earlier than normal due to the warmer conditions â€“ maybe a week earlier than what is considered average. Summer was very warm to very hot. January was particularly hot at times - only broken up by a week of cooler weather in the third week. Thankfully the heat dissipated mid February and much of the fruit was able to ripen in the cooler months of March & April.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were both machine and hand harvested, transported to the winery, crushed into small open fermenters, chilled and cold soaked for approx 4-5 days prior to the natural yeasts kicking in and beginning the ferment. Fermentation was completed within 12 days and the wine pressed and run into French 228L barrels for just on 18 months.'

reviews = "Don't just take our word for it. See what customers and critics are saying about the GCV Premium Shiraz."

testemonials = 'Deep purple-crimson; a very concentrated and powerful full-bodied shiraz with blackberry, dark chocolate, licorice and mocha flavours, the tannins ripe; carries its alcohol: 280 cases made. High quality Cork. 15% alc. 94/100 points.'

testemonialonyears = 'The fruit for this comes from the two oldest blocks of Shiraz on the vineyard. Varying percentages of both blocks make up the Premium depending on the year. Incredibly deep red, almost black in colour, this wine shows all the usual blackberry, star anise and ferrous characters that we have come to expect from this site.'
