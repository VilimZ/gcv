overview1 = 'The McAskill range consists of small volumes of the highest quality wine sourced exclusively from the Gaelic Cemetery Vineyard located in the well known sub region of White Hut.

tastingnotes = 'The appearance is very pale green with vibrant youthful hues. Aromatically, fresh green limes typical of this block come to the fore with subtle floral notes. The palate is quite pure and elegant built around salivating acidity with lemon drop and finger lime flavours. The balance between the acidity, texture and flavour profile is impeccable, powerful in flavour yet elegant in style. Although this wine can be enjoyed in its youth long term cellaring will reward those that wait.'

growingseason = 'The 2020 growing season required a deft hand in managing the vines. The winter season provided well below average rainfall, followed by a windy spring that caused low fruit set and resulting low yields. The benefit of this was with the dryer conditions the vines found a natural balance of smaller canopy size suitable for the low yields limiting vine stress. Whilst December was particularly hot the key ripening period of January and February had moderate temperatures which allowed us to pick the grapes with good acidity, flavour and freshness. A 20mm rain event on February 1 was a welcome relief and provided a final drink for the vines before harvest started.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were machine harvested in the cool, early hours of the morning, transported to the winery to be crushed, chilled and pressed as soon as possible prior to the juice being clarified by cold settling. It was then inoculated with a pure yeast culture, with fermentation carried out in stainless steel temperature controlled tanks for on average 25-30 days. The wine was fined, stabilised then filtered prior to bottling.'
