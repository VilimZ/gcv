growingseason = 'The 2020 growing season required a deft hand in managing the vines. The winter season provided well below average rainfall, followed by a windy spring that caused low fruit set and resulting low yields. The benefit of this was with the dryer conditions the vines found a natural balance of smaller canopy size suitable for the low yields limiting vine stress. Whilst December was particularly hot the key ripening period of January and February had moderate temperatures which allowed us to pick the grapes with good acidity, flavour and freshness. A 20mm rain event on February 1 was a welcome relief and provided a final drink for the vines before harvest started.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were machine harvested in the cool, early hours of the morning, transported to the winery to be crushed, chilled and pressed as soon as possible prior to the juice being clarified by cold settling. It was then inoculated with a pure yeast culture, with fermentation carried out in stainless steel temperature controlled tanks for on average 25-30 days. The wine was fined, stabilised then filtered prior to bottling.'
