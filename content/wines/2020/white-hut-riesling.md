growingseason = 'The 2020 growing season required a deft hand in managing the vines. The winter season provided well below average rainfall, followed by a windy spring that caused low fruit set and resulting low yields. The benefit of this was with the dryer conditions the vines found a natural balance of smaller canopy size suitable for the low yields limiting vine stress. Whilst December was particularly hot the key ripening period of January and February had moderate temperatures which allowed us to pick the grapes with good acidity, flavour and freshness. A 20mm rain event on February 1 was a welcome relief and provided a final drink for the vines before harvest started.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were both hand & machine harvested, transported to the winery, de-stemmed, pressed and the juice chilled prior to the being partially clarified by cold settling â€“ some solids were retained for texture and added complexity. It was then inoculated with a pure yeast culture, with fermentation carried out in stainless steel temperature-controlled tanks for 25-30 days. After fermentation the wine was stabilised and then filtered prior to bottling.'
