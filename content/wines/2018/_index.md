vintagenotes = 'The vintage was shaped by a typically cool winter, but with below average rainfall. Timing of budburst and flowering were pretty normal and harvest commenced on 23rd February for us. We experienced above average temperatures during January, but February and March were quite mild with no extended periods of heat. We received virtually no rain in either month. The 2018 vintage will be remembered as a really good Riesling vintage and is comparable to recent high-quality years such as 2016, 2015, 2013 and maybe 2006.'
