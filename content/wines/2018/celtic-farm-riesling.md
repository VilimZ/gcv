overview1 = 'The "entry level" Riesling but one that seriously over-delivers. Purity and flavor are abundant and it makes for sensational value.'

tastingnotes = 'Pale green in appearance with typical Clare Valley Riesling characters of lemon, cut apple and stone fruit along with some attractive floral notes. The palate is crisp, dry and soft - the balanced acidity ensuring a bright, clean finish. Great with any seafood – try it with Asian style steamed scallops with garlic & shallots. Worth a few years in the cellar too – say 5-7 years.'

growingseason = 'The vintage was shaped by a typically cool winter, but with below average rainfall. Timing of budburst and flowering were pretty normal and harvest commenced on 23rd February for us. We experienced above average temperatures during January, but February and March were quite mild with no extended periods of heat. We received virtually no rain in either month. The 2018 vintage will be remembered as a really good Riesling vintage and is comparable to recent high-quality years such as 2016, 2015, 2013 and maybe 2006.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were machine harvested in the cool, early hours of the morning, transported to the winery to be crushed, chilled and pressed as soon as possible prior to the juice being clarified by cold settling. It was then inoculated with a pure yeast culture, with fermentation carried out in stainless steel temperature controlled tanks for on average 25-30 days. The wine was fined, stabilised then filtered prior to bottling.'

reviews = "Don't just take our word for it. See what customers and critics are saying about the GCV Celtic Farm Riesling."

testemonials = 'The less expensive, more ready to rumble little brother of the Gaelic Cemetery Riesling. More weight and less purity than its big brother, but more open and affable as a youngster. There’s a slight chalkiness to the texture and a twist of lime rind bitterness on the finish along with lime, lemon, apple and bathroom florals. Clean acidity and juicy sweetness makes this a very good drink. 94/100 points'
