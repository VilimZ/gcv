growingseason = 'The vintage was shaped by a typically cool winter, but with below average rainfall. Timing of budburst and flowering were pretty normal and harvest commenced on 23rd February for us. We experienced above average temperatures during January, but February and March were quite mild with no extended periods of heat. We received virtually no rain in either month. The 2018 vintage will be remembered as a really good Riesling vintage and is comparable to recent high-quality years such as 2016, 2015, 2013 and maybe 2006.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were machine harvested in the cool, early hours of the morning, transported to the winery to be crushed, chilled and pressed as soon as possible prior to the juice being clarified by cold settling. It was then inoculated with a pure yeast culture, with fermentation carried out in stainless steel temperature controlled tanks for on average 25-30 days. The wine was fined, stabilised then filtered prior to bottling.'

reviews = "Don't just take our word for it. See what customers and critics are saying about the GCV Premium Shiraz."
