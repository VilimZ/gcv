overview1 = 'This premium riesling is nothing short of world class. Unmistakable citrus, salinity and even a slight chalkiness characterise the palate. The acidity is great, but supremely well balanced.'

tastingnotes = 'Pale green in appearance with typical Clare Valley Riesling characters of lemon, lime and grapefruit. Throw in some subtle bath powder and floral notes and it makes for a very attractive nose. The palate is fresh, crisp and dry: the concentrated flavours and bright acidity in harmony with the long, textural talc-like finish. Try with pan fried SA wild catch snapper. Also good for long term aging – this wine will run for 10+ years easily.'

growingseason = 'The vintage was shaped by a typically cool winter, but with below average rainfall. Timing of budburst and flowering were normal and harvest commenced on 23rd February for us. While we experienced above average temperatures during January, February and March were quite mild with no extended periods of heat. We received virtually nil rain in either month. The 2018 vintage will be remembered as a high-quality Riesling vintage and is comparable to recent very good years such as 2016, 2015, 2013 and 2007.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were both hand & machine harvested, transported to the winery, de-stemmed, pressed and the juice chilled prior to the being partially clarified by cold settling – some solids were retained for texture and added complexity. It was then inoculated with a pure yeast culture, with fermentation carried out in stainless steel temperature-controlled tanks for 25-30 days. After fermentation the wine was stabilised and then filtered prior to bottling.'
