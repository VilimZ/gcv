testemonialonyears = 'Deep red in colour, the wine displays ripe satsuma plum and blackcurrant, a little chocolate and a hint of cedary French oak. The palate is quite rich but retains a degree of elegance with its balanced acidity. It also has a good depth of juicy, fleshy dark berry fruit. A really attractive Clare red blend which will repay medium term cellaring – say 3-6 years.'

overview1 = 'Maroon red with aromatic notes of cedar and spice. Matured only in French oak has allowed a more structural wine to develop adding texture, spice and a long granular tannin profile.'

growingseason = 'The 2018 vintage was shaped by a cool winter with above average rainfall followed by a dry and quite warm spring. Budburst was almost 2 weeks earlier than normal due to the warmer conditions and, consequently harvest was also very early – we commenced vintage on Feb 4th. The Summer was quite mild really and did not get hot for any extended period, apart from a few days around New Year and mid February conditions were very temperate for the rest of the harvest.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were machine harvested in the cool, early hours of the morning, transported to the winery to be crushed, chilled and pressed as soon as possible prior to the juice being clarified by cold settling. It was then inoculated with a pure yeast culture, with fermentation carried out in stainless steel temperature controlled tanks for on average 25-30 days. The wine was fined, stabilised then filtered prior to bottling.'

reviews = "Don't just take our word for it. See what customers and critics are saying about the GCV Celtic Farm Shiraz Cabernet."

testemonials = 'Deep crimson-purple: combinations of some or all of these varieties have always prospered in the Clare Valley, Wendouree and Leasingham Bin 56 being examples. This ticks the boxes set by those great wines. Deep crimson-purple, red and black berry fruits hold hands, encouraged by ripe tannins. 93/100 points'
