tastingnotes = 'Deep red colour as is the norm with the wines from the Gaelic Cemetery Vineyard. This wine possesses intense blackcurrant / redcurrant and mulberry-like aromas along with some subtle cedary notes. The palate is warm, firm and structured, but retains the elegance that we expect to see in Cabernet based wines from Clare. It will take several years in the cellar to reveal its undoubted potential. Very good cellaring proposition. Try with grilled lamb backstraps.'

growingseason = 'The 2018 vintage was shaped by a cool winter with above average rainfall followed by a dry and quite warm spring. Budburst was almost 2 weeks earlier than normal due to the warmer conditions and, consequently harvest was also very early â€“ we commenced vintage on Feb 4th. The Summer was quite mild really and did not get hot for any extended period, apart from a few days around New Year and mid February conditions were very temperate for the rest of the harvest.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were both machine and hand harvested, transported to the winery, destemmed into 2 tonne open fermenters, chilled and cold soaked for approx 72 hours prior to the natural yeasts kicking in and beginning the ferment. Fermentation was completed within 12 days prior to the wine being pressed and run into new and used French 225L barrels for just on 18 months.'
