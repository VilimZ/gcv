vintagenotes = 'The 2009 vintage saw a welcome return to normal seasonal conditions for the Clare Valley. While most of South Eastern Australia was affected by the continuance of a severe drought with crop levels being reduced and devastating bushfires in Victoria creating havoc, thankfully South Australia and the Clare Valley was immune to all this. A mild summer allowed the grapes to ripen quite steadily and develop excellent flavour concentration while retaining good levels of natural acidity. 2009 has the potential to be one of the top 2 or 3 vintages of the last decade.'
