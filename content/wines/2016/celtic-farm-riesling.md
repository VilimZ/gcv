growingseason = 'The 2016 vintage was shaped by a cool winter with average rainfall followed by a dry, warm spring and quite a hot December. Budburst was earlier than normal due to the warmer conditions in September and as a consequence harvest was also very early – we commenced vintage on Feb 9th. Thankfully January and February were quite mild with below average maximum and minimum temperatures experienced for both months. Around 30mm of rain received on 29th January went a long way towards shaping the vintage also. It has probably turned a potentially ordinary vintage into something potentially quite special.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were machine harvested in the cool, early hours of the morning, transported to the winery to be crushed, chilled and pressed as soon as possible prior to the juice being clarified by cold settling. It was then inoculated with a pure yeast culture, with fermentation carried out in stainless steel temperature controlled tanks for on average 25-30 days. The wine was fined, stabilised then filtered prior to bottling.'

reviews = "Don't just take our word for it. See what customers and critics are saying about the GCV Celtic Farm Riesling."

testemonials = 'The less expensive, more ready to rumble little brother of the Gaelic Cemetery Riesling. More weight and less purity than its big brother, but more open and affable as a youngster. There’s a slight chalkiness to the texture and a twist of lime rind bitterness on the finish along with lime, lemon, apple and bathroom florals. Clean acidity and juicy sweetness makes this a very good drink. 94/100 points'
