testemonialonyears = 'Deep red in colour, the wine displays ripe satsuma plum and blackcurrant, a little chocolate and a hint of cedary French oak. The palate is quite rich but retains a degree of elegance with its balanced acidity. It also has a good depth of juicy, fleshy dark berry fruit. A really attractive Clare red blend which will repay medium term cellaring – say 3-6 years.'

The palate is quite rich but retains a degree of elegance with its balanced acidity. It also has a good depth of juicy, fleshy dark berry fruit held in check by some fine grained tannins. A really attractive Clare red blend which will repay medium term cellaring – say 4-6 years. Try with game pie.'

growingseason = 'The 2016 vintage was shaped by a cool winter with average rainfall followed by a dry, warm spring and quite a hot December. Budburst was earlier than normal due to the warmer conditions in September and consequently harvest was also very early – we commenced vintage on Feb 9th. Thankfully January and February were quite mild with below average maximum and minimum temperatures experienced for both months. Around 30mm of rain received on 29th January went a long way towards shaping the vintage also. It has probably turned a potentially ordinary vintage into something potentially quite special.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were both machine and hand harvested, transported to the winery, destemmed into small open fermenters, chilled and macerated for approx 3-4 days prior to the natural yeasts kicking in and beginning the ferment. Fermentation was completed within 12 days prior to the wine being pressed and run into used French 228L barrels for 18 months.'

reviews = "Don't just take our word for it. See what customers and critics are saying about the GCV Celtic Farm Shiraz Cabernet."

testemonials = 'Deep crimson-purple: combinations of some or all of these varieties have always prospered in the Clare Valley, Wendouree and Leasingham Bin 56 being examples. This ticks the boxes set by those great wines. Deep crimson-purple, red and black berry fruits hold hands, encouraged by ripe tannins. 93/100 points.'
