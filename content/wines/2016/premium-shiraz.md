tastingnotes = 'Maroon red with dark fruit flavours of ripe plum and blackberry are immediately evident with hints of mocha and brown spices. An even palate of dark fruit, layered texture and fine tannin structure makes a well-balanced, approachable wine with a high degree of complexity and drinkability. Still youthful / primary in flavour profile with subtle oak adding bitter chocolate, nutmeg, and thyme notes. A wine that can be enjoyed now or carefully cellared.'

growingseason = 'The 2016 vintage was shaped by a cool winter with average rainfall followed by a dry, warm spring and quite a hot December. Budburst was earlier than normal due to the warmer conditions in September and as a consequence harvest was also very early – we commenced vintage on Feb 9th. Thankfully January and February were quite mild with below average maximum and minimum temperatures experienced for both months. Around 30mm of rain received on 29th January went a long way towards shaping the vintage also. It has probably turned a potentially ordinary vintage into something potentially quite special.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were both hand & machine harvested, transported to the winery, de stemmed, pressed and the juice chilled prior to the being partially clarified by cold settling – some solids were retained for texture and added complexity. It was then inoculated with a pure yeast culture, with fermentation carried out in stainless steel temperature controlled tanks for 25-30 days. After fermentation the wine was fined, stabilised and then filtered prior to bottling.'
