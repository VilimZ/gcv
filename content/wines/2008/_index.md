vintagenotes = 'Most of South Eastern Australia was affected by a severe drought with crop levels being reduced significantly in most regions. A severe heat wave in the first half of March saw sugar accumulate quite rapidly after verasion, so timing of harvest was crucial to making good wines. Those who got it right managed to make high quality wines of great colour and backbone that retained good levels of natural acidity as well as plenty of mid palate flavor.'
