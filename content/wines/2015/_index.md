vintagenotes = 'The 2015 vintage was shaped by a cool winter with above average rainfall followed by a dry and quite warm spring. Budburst was almost 2 weeks earlier than normal due to the warmer conditions and as a consequence harvest was also very early â€“ we commenced vintage on Feb 4th. The Summer was quite mild really and did not get hot for any extended period. Apart from a few hot days around New Year and mid February conditions were very mild for the rest of the harvest.'
