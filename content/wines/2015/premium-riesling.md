overview1 = 'This premium riesling is nothing short of world class. Unmistakable citrus, salinity and even a slight chalkiness characterise the palate. The acidity is great, but supremely well balanced.'

tastingnotes = 'Pale green in appearance with typical Clare Valley Riesling characters of lemon, lime and apple plus some bath salts/talc elements also on display as well. The palate is fresh, crisp and dry; the concentrated flavours and balanced acidity works in conjunction with the long, textural finish. Try with Gruyere cheese.'

growingseason = 'The 2015 vintage was shaped by a cool winter with above average rainfall followed by a dry and quite warm spring. Budburst was almost 2 weeks earlier than normal due to the warmer conditions and as a consequence harvest was also very early – we commenced vintage on Feb 4th. The summer was quite mild really and did not get hot for any extended period. Apart from a few hot days around New Year and mid February conditions were very mild for the rest of the harvest.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were both hand & machine harvested, transported to the winery, de stemmed, pressed and the juice chilled prior to the being partially clarified by cold settling – some solids were retained for texture and added complexity. It was then inoculated with a pure yeast culture, with fermentation carried out in stainless steel temperature controlled tanks for 25-30 days. After fermentation the wine was fined, stabilised and then filtered prior to bottling.'

reviews = "Don't just take our word for it. See what customers and critics are saying about the GCV Celtic Farm Riesling."

testemonials = '4 trophies, 3 in riesling categories, and Best Wine of Show at the Clare Valley Wine Show ’15. This starts where its gold medal-winning sibling finishes; it is awesome in the way it exerts its power, taking hold of the palate without any fuss, then tightening and lengthening its grip each time it is retasted. The rainbow of citrus fruits pays scant attention to the slatey acidity that is the bedrock of its long-term development. Screwcap. 12.5% alc. 97/100 points.'
