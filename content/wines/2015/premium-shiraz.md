tastingnotes = 'Maroon red with dark fruit flavours of ripe plum and blackberry are immediately evident with hints of mocha and brown spices. An even palate of dark fruit, layered texture and fine tannin structure makes a well-balanced, approachable wine with a high degree of complexity and drinkability.

growingseason = 'The 2015 vintage was shaped by a cool winter with above average rainfall followed by a dry and quite warm spring. Budburst was almost 2 weeks earlier than normal due to the warmer conditions and as a consequence harvest was also very early – we commenced vintage on Feb 4th. The summer was quite mild really and did not get hot for any extended period. Apart from a few hot days around New Year and mid February conditions were very mild for the rest of the harvest.'

winemaking = 'The grapes for this wine were both hand & machine harvested, transported to the winery, de stemmed, pressed and the juice chilled prior to the being partially clarified by cold settling – some solids were retained for texture and added complexity. It was then inoculated with a pure yeast culture, with fermentation carried out in stainless steel temperature controlled tanks for 25-30 days. After fermentation the wine was fined, stabilised and then filtered prior to bottling.'
