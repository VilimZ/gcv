                        <p>The Gaelic Cemetery&nbsp;Vineyard itself was established in 1996 on a parcel of land
                            immediately adjacent to the historic Gaelic Cemetery approximately five kilometres due north
                            of the Clare township â€“ hence the name.</p>
                        <p>The Gaelic Cemetery&nbsp;Vineyard label design reflects the simplicity and minimal
                            intervention approach we take with the wine. The image of the thistle is taken from an old
                            headstone in the cemetery.</p>
