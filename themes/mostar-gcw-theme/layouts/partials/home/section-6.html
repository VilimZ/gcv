                <p>“4 trophies, 3 in riesling categories, and Best Wine of Show at the Clare Valley Wine Show ’15. This
                    starts where its gold medal-winning sibling finishes; it is awesome in the way it exerts its power,
                    taking hold of the palate without any fuss, then tightening and lengthening its grip each time it is
                    retasted. The rainbow of citrus fruits pays scant attention to the slatey acidity that is the
                    bedrock of its long-term development..”</p>

                    classic lime juice, kaffir lime and jasmin scented perfume, while the palate rushes with crisp
                    texture, crystalline acidity and a flourish of mixed citrus juice in flavour. Poisted, tight,
                    intense, this is an outstanding release. Destined for long term cellaring"</p>
