vintagenotes = 'The vintage was shaped by a typically cool winter, but with below average rainfall. Spring rains were also down. Budburst and flowering were normal and harvest commenced in late February for us. While we experienced above average temperatures during January and much of February, conditions were quite mild once vintage began in earnest. The 2019 vintage will be remembered as another high-quality Clare Riesling vintage with lower alcohols and bright acids a feature of our wines.'
